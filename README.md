# Vance Joy – First Time

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Come over to my house jump in
the neighbor's pool, it felt
nice, felt so nice
And it was getting dark, you
wrapped your long legs around
me, I held on tight
Lying in my bed the unfamiliar
sheets felt so cool on your skin
When your daddy called said you
were at a friend's
And we walked the long way home
Going on, my first impression, I
recall you wearing white
There was something sweet in the
air, babe, that summer night
There will always be another
time for us to fall in love
But it never cuts you quite as
deep as that first time
You'll find out that the deepest
cut is the first time
The first times always cut the
deepest
Breathe me with your hands
Show me a safe place and I'll
come down, yeah I'll come down
Can you recognize the look upon
my face?
It's on my lips, it's in my eyes
This bar will never break, won't
you say it one more time
Won't you say my name, won't you
say my name
This bar will never break, won't
you say, say my name
Going on, my first impression, I
recall you wearing white
There was something sweet in the
air, babe, that summer night
There will always be another
time for us to fall in love
But it never cuts you quite as
deep as that first time
You'll find out that the deepest
cut is the first time
The first times always cut the
deepest
Going on, my first impression, I
recall you wearing white
There was something sweet in the
air, babe, that summer night
There will always be another
time for us to fall in love
But it never cuts you quite as
deep as that first time
You'll find out that the deepest
cut is the first time
The first times always cut the
deepest
